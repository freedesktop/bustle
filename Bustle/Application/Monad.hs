{- The goal is to have the standard Reader/State stack for immutable and
 - mutable application state, but also be able to reconstitute it inside GLib
 - callbacks (which are in IO).
 -
 - We implement this by storing both the configuration and the state in an
 - IORef, and provide functions to reconstitute the environment inside a
 - callback. Inspired by this excellent email, titled Monadic Tunnelling:
 -   <http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2007-July/028501.html>
 -
 - You're intended to write 'type B a = Bustle SomeConfig SomeState a' for
 - brevity. Then, within a 'B foo' action, if you want to connect to a GLib
 - signal, you say something like this:
 -
 -    onDance :: Badger -> IO a -> IO ()
 -    dancedCB :: B a
 -
 -    embedIO $ onDance x . makeCallback dancedCB
